                                <h2>Tonii K. Moses</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Named by the Calgary Herald in 2007 as a “Compelling Calgarian” to watch and since then Tonii Moses has built a reputation as a tough criminal lawyer known for her strategic thinking and effectiveness in the courtroom.  Devoting her entire legal career to the practice of criminal law, Tonii Moses’ career has been defined by taking on a variety of tough high profile cases. Currently, Tonii Moses is defending the rights of the client in Okotoks to protect his family. Tonii is also defending a First Degree Murder and also a gang-related Conspiracy to Commit Murder in Calgary. She is also defending a 2nd degree murder in Lethbridge, and 2 other 2nd degree murders in Calgary. Tonii is defending a client who has been charged with the largest seizure of methamphetamine in Medicine Hat’s history. </span><span class="s2">Tonii is also defending n</span><span class="s1">umerous sexual assaults in Calgary, wiretap cases, and impaired driving offences including DRE (Drug Recognition Evaluation). Tonii’s experience in high profile cases and her vast experience with serious charges, gives her a unique perspective to ensure that she will develop a strategic plan for success in your case no matter what you have been charged with.  </span></p>
<hr><p class="p2"> </p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">TRIAL LAWYER</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the last 17 years, including 3 years at Student Legal Assistance as a law student and 1 year at Calgary Legal Guidance as an articling student, Tonii Moses' practice has focused primarily on defending individuals, both adult and youth, at the trial level. She has successfully defended individuals against all criminal offences including: murder, organized crime, sexual assault, impaired driving/DRE, drug offences, domestic assault, white collar crime, child pornography, and internet based crimes.   She prides herself on defending all of her clients with the same level of intensity and professionalism regardless of the charges they face.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tonii Moses has defined her career defending some of the highest profile and difficult sexual assault cases.  She understands that just the allegations of sexual assault could change your life forever.  If you have been charged with a sex crime, you want an experienced defence lawyer who will protect your rights, cross examine the so-called “victim” with vigor and make sure you get to tell your side of the story.  Tonii Moses truly cares about the effect on your life before, during and after the accusation, the charges and the trial. Tonii Moses has tried numerous sexual assault cases winning outright acquittals when other lawyers thought the case was impossible to win.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a recent interview, Criminal Defence Lawyer, Tonii K. Moses said, “Accusations of sexual assault are the easiest accusations to make-up because the so-called victim is automatically believed often times without proper investigation.  As soon as this occurs, the accused person should contact a lawyer so that we can start our own investigation and take the offensive.” Tonii Moses has serious concerns and skepticism regarding the “I believe you” and “Me too” campaigns that may hinder the accused’s right to a fair trial.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tonii Moses has successfully defended against a variety of driving offences including DUI/impaired driving, refusal, over 80, and dangerous driving.  Tonii Moses is up to date on the law in an area that is constantly evolving.  She prides herself on providing comprehensive briefs of law to defend her client’s Charter rights to successfully defend the case.  Tonii Moses is victorious in obtaining withdrawal of charges, curative discharges and acquittals. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tonii Moses has successfully defended a wide range of different types of drugs including cocaine, marihuana, ecstasy, methamphetamine, heroin, fentanyl etc. with varying quantities from small amounts to pounds and kilograms.  Even the smallest amount of drugs can affect your life if you obtain a criminal record so it is critical that a drug lawyer who has experience in these matters utilizes every defence available.  Tonii Moses will seek to find a defence to your drug matter that may include fighting a Search Warrant, Wire Tap, and making a Charter Application to exclude the drug evidence, arguing possession, and arguing that the police did not follow proper procedures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tonii Moses has defended several violent offences including domestic violence to murder/manslaughter charges successfully with positive results.  These types of offences require your lawyer to consider every possible defence due to the seriousness of the charge.  Tonii Moses has defended a range of murder cases from the most complicated first-degree murder cases involving firearms, wiretap and undercover operations by police officers to manslaughters and assaults involving knife fights.  Tonii Moses has defended a murder case successfully where the client was found unfit to stand trial thus avoiding jail.  She has had a manslaughter case withdrawn by the Crown Prosecutor.  She has had second-degree murder charges reduced to manslaughter.  In the infamous FOB and FK gang-related homicides, Tonii has had 3 first-degree murder charges reduced to 1 second-degree murder.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a recent interview, when asked to comment about a client charged with committing 3 homicides, Tonii Moses stated: “Regardless of the information released by the police, the accused is presumed innocent.  In Canada, the presumption of innocence still exists  no matter the charge.”</span></p>
<hr><p class="p2"> </p>
<h3 class="p1">CRIMINAL LAW EXPERIENCE</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Given her experience, Tonii Moses is often consulted by organizations and media to comment on developments in the law including in July 2014 where she was asked to comment on the recent decision from the Supreme Court of Canada of R. v. Hart 2014 SCC 52 which dealt with the controversial investigative technique commonly referred to as a “Mr. Big Operation”(<a href="http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/calgary/Calgary+lawyers+cheer+limits+stings/10080849/story.html"><span class="s2">http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/calgary/Calgary+lawyers+cheer+limits+stings/10080849/story.html</span></a>.)  Tonii Moses has also run seminars on cross-examination for University of Calgary law students involved in Student Legal Assistance.  She has conducted mock trials with Calgary Police Service new recruits to educate on cross-examination.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Successfully defending criminal cases involves a commitment to stay on top of new legal developments as well as advancements in investigative techniques.  Tonii Moses’ membership to the largest organization for Criminal Defence lawyers in the United States (National Association of Criminal Defence Lawyers (NACDL)) has enabled her to do this.  Through her attendance in a number of conferences throughout the United States including “Defending Drug Cases”, “Forensic Science and the Law” and “Zealous Advocacy in Sexual Assault and Child Victims Cases” Ms. Moses has developed advanced cross-examination techniques and in depth knowledge of a variety of psychological and medical defences. Tonii has just recently attended the Forensic Science conference in Las Vegas that consisted of sessions in defending against expert evidence called by the Crown in DNA analysis in sexual assault charges etc., Drug Recognition Evaluations (DRE) in impaired driving in marihuana charges, Firearms Analysis, and Cell phone/Mobile Forensics, and Pathologists in homicide charges.</span></p>
<hr><p class="p2"> </p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">RIGHT TO BAIL</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tonii Moses has obtained bail for her clients at the Court of Appeal, Court of Queen’s Bench, and Provincial Court for all types of charges from Murder, Attempted murder, aggravated assault, sexual assault, internet crime, child pornography, domestic violence, firearms, and trafficking drugs.  Tonii Moses' belief is that obtaining bail for her client is of the utmost importance.  The client’s release will not only benefit the client’s wellbeing but also allow the client to assist in defending his or her own case.</span></p>
<hr><p class="p2"> </p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">EDUCATION and background</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ms. Moses received her Bachelor of Law from the University of Calgary in 2003.  She also received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Calgary where she majored in Political Science and minored in Economics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tonii volunteers with the Dare to Dream Program teaching junior high students at A. E. Cross and G.P. Vanier schools how to conduct mock criminal trials. Tonii is a member of the Board of Directors at Simon House Recovery Center. She is a supporter of the Calgary Drug Treatment Court, Alberta Adolescent Recovery Center (AARC), the Enbridge Famous Five, Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan, YMCA Walk a Mile in Her Shoes, the Canadian Cancer Society, the Humane Society, and the World Society for the Protection of Animals (W.S.P.A.). She is also a supporter of Alberta College of Art and Design (ACAD), Contemporary Calgary, and PARKLUXE fashion events. She was recently named one of <a href="http://www.avenuecalgary.com/Shopping-Style/Calgarys-Best-Dressed/2018/Tonii-Moses-Managing-Partner-Moses-Urquhart-Criminal-Defence-Firm/" target="_blank">Avenue Magazine’s Best Dressed 2018</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ms. Moses is also a member of the Law Society of Alberta, the Canadian Bar Association, the Calgary Criminal Defence Lawyers Association, and the National Association of Defence Lawyers in the United States. </span></p>
