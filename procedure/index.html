The return date will depend on where your matter is being heard (i.e. Calgary, Edmonton, Red Deer, Lethbridge, etc.).</p>
<p class="p1">If you are currently in custody, your matter will be heard in Court as scheduled. If you are out of custody, but your matter is one of emergency, you should contact your lawyer immediately to see whether your matter can be addressed in court. Only matters that are emergency or in-custody will be heard in court.</p>

                <p class="p1">As of March 17, 2020, the Provincial Court of Alberta has limited court appearances to matters that are “in-custody or urgent matters.” This policy is currently in effect from March 17, 2020 to May 22, 2020.</p>
<p class="p1">No members of the public are permitted in the Court house unless you are required for a court matter (such as a witness in a trial or media personnel). Your lawyer will continue to have access to the Court house for in-custody and urgent matters.</p>
<p class="p1">What this means is, if you are not in-custody (you are out of jail) and you have a criminal court appearance in Provincial Court between March 17, 2020 and May 22, 2020, you do not need to attend court. If you are out of custody, your matter will be automatically adjourned 10 weeks from the date of your scheduled court appearance. For example, if your next court date was on April 1, 2020 in Calgary Provincial Court, your matter will automatically be adjourned by the Court to June 10, 2020 in Calgary.</p>
<p class="p1">If your matter is a regional matter (Airdrie, Canmore, Cochrane, Didsbury, Okotoks, Siksika, Strathmore, Tsuut’ina Nation or Turner Valley) and was set for trial, your matter will be adjourned approximately 10 weeks to the next docket date in that jurisdiction. For example, if your matter was scheduled for trial on Friday March 20, 2020 in Airdrie Provincial Court, your matter will be adjourned approximately 10 weeks to the next docket date in Airdrie, which is Thursday May 28, 2020.</p>

<p class="p1">If you are out of custody and your next court date is scheduled between March 17, 2020 and May 22, 2020, you do not need to appear in court and no warrant will issue if you do not show up. The Provincial Court has automatically adjourned your matter for 10 weeks from the date of your court appearance without you or your lawyer appearing. For example: if your next scheduled court date was March 17, 2020 in Calgary Provincial Court, your matter has been automatically adjourned to May 25, 2020 in Calgary. Another example: if your next scheduled court date was April 15, 2020 in Canmore Provincial Court, your matter will be adjourned to June 24, 2020 in Canmore.</p>
<p class="p1">You or your lawyer will be required to attend on your next court date (between May 25, 2020 and July 17, 2020). The lawyers at Moses Urquhart Criminal Defence firm will be appearing on behalf of the clients if we are retained. We ask that you stay in touch with us. If you do not have a lawyer and you do not attend on that date, a warrant may issue for your arrest.</p>
<p class="p1">Note: This is subject to further update from the Provincial Court of Alberta regarding any extension of restrictions on court appearances.</p>
<h5>Queen’s Bench:</h5>
<p class="p1">If you are out of custody and your next court date is scheduled between March 16, 2020 and May 1, 2020, you do not need to appear in court and no warrant will issue if you do not show up. The Court of Queen’s Bench has automatically adjourned your court appearance without you or your lawyer appearing.</p>
<p class="p1">Your next court date in Queen’s Bench will depend on where your matter is being heard. For example, if you are out of custody and your matter is being heard in Calgary in the Court of Queen’s Bench, your matter will be adjourned as follows:</p>
<ul><li>If your matter was scheduled for: the Weeks of March 16 &amp; 23, 2020:

                <p class="p1">Due to the state of emergency declared in Alberta and impending difficulties in maintaining the necessary level of sanitation, close quarters, regular physical contact and deficient hygiene in remand centres and jails, Crown Prosecutors have been encouraged to review their in-custody matters in light of the COVID-19 emergency. Crown Prosecutors are now to include in their process the impending situation of COVID-19 spreading in the remand system and protecting alleged offenders from the medical issue, while still protecting the public from any substantial likelihood of that accused reoffending.</p>
<p class="p1">If your boyfriend/husband or relative is currently in custody in a Remand Centre and awaiting a bail hearing, and they are not charged with violent or very serious crimes, it is possible that they will be released at an earlier opportunity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether your relative will be released will depend largely on the proposed bail plan going forward, any previous forms of release they were release on, and the type of charges they are facing. Typically, the more serious or violent the crime, the less likely it will be that the Crown and the Court will agree to an accused person’s release.</p>

<h5>Court of Queen’s Bench – Adult and Youth Criminal Matters</h5>
<p class="p1">On March 16, 2020 the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta limited court appearances to matters that are “emergency or urgent matters.” All jury trials that were not currently in progress on March 16, 2020 have been suspended until May 31, 2020.</p>
<p class="p1">As of March 20, 2020, the Court of Queen’s Bench confirmed this policy and extended it to be in effect from March 16, 2020 to May 1, 2020.</p>
<p class="p1">If you are not in-custody and you have a criminal court appearance in Queen’s Bench between March 16, 2020 and May 1, 2020, you do not need to attend court. Your matter will automatically be adjourned in the jurisdiction your matter is being heard.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, if you are out of custody and your matter is being heard in Calgary in the Court of Queen’s Bench, your matter will be adjourned as follows:</p>
<ul><li>If your matter was scheduled for: the Weeks of March 16 &amp; 23, 2020:
<ul><li>Adjourned to: Friday June 12, 2020 in Queen’s Bench Criminal Appearance Court.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If your matter was scheduled for: the Weeks of March 30 &amp; April 6, 2020:
<ul><li>Adjourned to: Friday June 19, 2020 in Queen’s Bench Criminal Appearance Court.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If your matter was scheduled for: the Weeks of April 13 &amp; 20, 2020:
<ul><li>Adjourned to: Friday June 26, 2020 in Queen’s Bench Criminal Appearance Court.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If your matter was scheduled for: the Week of April 27, 2020:
<ul><li>Adjourned to: Thursday July 2, 2020 in Queen’s Bench Criminal Appearance Court.</li>

                <p class="p1">In the case of R v Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, the Supreme Court found there are presumptive ceilings on the time it should take to bring an accused person to trial. This means that your case must be heard within a certain period of time. In cases going to trial in the Provincial Court, the presumptive ceiling is 18 months for a matter to be concluded. In cases going to trial in the Court of Queen’s Bench, the presumptive ceiling is 30 months. In cases where the matter exceeds 18 months of delay in Provincial Court, or 30 months in Queen’s Bench, the presumption is that the delay is unreasonable. As such, the charges against the accused will be stayed. This is the case unless the Crown establishes the presence of exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p class="p1">The impact of COVID-19 and the respective delay on criminal proceedings in both Provincial Court and Queen’s Bench have yet to be solidified. Since the COVID-19 outbreak and its effect on court proceedings are a unique and fluid situation, arguments on the effect of delay will be addressed by your lawyer once the international pandemic has subsidized and at the earliest opportunity.

<p class="p1"><strong>Financial Eligibility:</strong><br> Whether you are financially eligible for Legal Aid coverage will depend on your net family income, family size, and assets. Your income will be assessed for the last 30 days and last 12 months to determine whether you are financially eligible for assistance from Legal Aid Alberta.</p>
