									<p class="review__content">If only we had met Tonii, Alin and Robin, along with Jennifer and Hannah a few years ago after terrible representation from a firm which seemed to see a client on Legal Aid as not as worthy of a full defense.  In one meeting and one Court appearance Tonii showed us more respect and commitment than we had received in three years.  I fully believe that if we had found Tonii first we would not have gone through such a difficult and traumatic experience which continues to affect us.</p>

									<p class="review__content">Tonii is a life saver. She was very meticulous in regards to all the details on my file. Tonii was truly caring and compassionate about my perspective and the outcome. Tonii didn&#039;t hesitate to diving right into my file. With such a short period between when I first met Tonii and my trial, Tonii moved really fast and expedited the entire process. Not only did Tonii go through all the charges, she indicated and assisted with my immigration issues. I could not be more thankful for her assistance. I really appreciate everything Tonii did for me. I would absolutely recommend Tonii and cannot think of anyone else that was a caring and professional as Tonii. I would highly recommend her to anyone. </p>

									<p class="review__content">In a panicked and stressed state we called several lawyers on a weekend and Tonii answered her phone, went over facts and immediately eased our fear of the unknown. Through out the whole process, Tonii always responded in a timely fashion and always communicated the facts so that we were never panicked. We never doubted in her ability and always felt that we were so lucky that we had her on our side. The outcome of the case was better than we could have possible expected and I am sure that we would not have had this outcome had it not been for Tonii. If someone needs a criminal defence attorney, she is the only option in my opinion.</p>

									<p class="review__content">After 5 long years awaiting trial and my final verdict, I am finally relieved to have all my charges acquitted. Andrea Urquhart was hands down the best lawyer I&#039;ve ever came across in my entire life. I have went through many different lawyers before but never have I met someone with her skills and high calibre. I would most definitely recommend Andrea Urquhart as your defense attorney. I&#039;m highly satisfied based on my outcome and I appreciate her team she works with who made this all happened for me. I would like to thank Vanessa, her assistant for always responding to me as quick as possible. Words can&#039;t describe the gratitude I have for Andrea Urquhart and Tonii Rouslton.</p>

Tonii was passionate toward my situation and had an understanding through experience of the position I was in.  Her insight was invaluable to me as she knew what was at stake and how to use the somewhat unique circumstances to plea my case.  Jennifer came in right behind Tonii and took care of the details so Tonii could focus on my case, they worked together in perfect synchronicity.  I would recommend Tonii and her office to anyone who wants to work with a lawyer that is confident, intelligent, outstanding at her job, and wants the best possible outcome of her client.  Tonii not only knows the law, but how to navigate her way through the inner working of the system, she is there to successfully represent her client – period.</p>

At a time in my life when my future was unknown and my life was turned upside down, TONII ROULSTON  helped me put my life back together for the better.  I was isolated from the rest of the world, vulnerable and worried where my future would lead me, with multiple federal charges , and evidence that the CROWN had against me.  Thanks to TONII ROULSTON for giving me a hour of her time for my consultation before mentioning any fees, when other known firms only gave me  5 minutes. And thanks to TONII ROULSTON for caring for my well-being. I came out of this horrible, tragic event in my life with the biggest smile on my face. Due to her aggressiveness and her immaculate skills in and out the courtroom. My future is now worry-free and thats the best feeling I ever had. It&#039;s been a privilege and an honor to have TONII ROULSTON as my lawyer . I dont know where I&#039;d be without her services today. And that being said I would strongly recommend her to anybody.</p>

									<p class="review__content">When I heard the letters &quot;D-U-I&quot; I was terrified of the consequences that would follow. I didn&#039;t know what to do, or who to call, especially since I&#039;m not from Calgary - I&#039;m not even from Alberta. Not knowing any lawyers in the city I did what most would probably do, I googled and found Tonii Roulston. Called her on the weekend and left her a voicemail, she called back the same day! She fully explained options and what our best course of action would be to have the charges dropped. After speaking with Tonii I knew I had made the right choice as she was diligent in finding a way to have the charges dropped, kept constant contact, provided updates, made me feel as if I was a person not just another &quot;case&quot;, and she had a fantastic understanding of the Calgary court system. Tonii got my charges dropped and helped me avoid all repercussions. I found her name on Google by chance but I consider it one of the luckiest choices I have ever made. I would fully recommend her to anyone in need of a lawyer.</p>

									<p class="review__content">When I was pulled over and arrested for impaired driving following a wedding reception, I was convinced that my life was over; the shame, embarrassment and anxiety were almost too much to bear. Tonii Roulston immediately put my mind at ease with her obvious competence and strategic thinking, and was able to eventually have the charges withdrawn; she is compassionate and highly professional, and I was very happy that I chose her and her team.</p>

									<p class="review__content">Tonii Roulston of Roulston Urquhart was invaluable in helping me get through a difficult situation. Her straightforward, no-nonsense attitude and her high level of confidence put me at ease, knowing that my case was in good hands. Her professionalism was beyond what I expected and she was always available for any questions that I had. Not only was the outcome of my case the best possible one for my situation, but it was also an outcome that was not even considered by other defense attorneys that I consulted. I highly recommend Tonii and her firm.</p>
